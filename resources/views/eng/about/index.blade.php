                    COVID-19 situation continues, and various situations inside and outside the country are serious. However, as the chairman of the Korean Heart Rhythm Society (KHRS), I will try to further develop our excellent KHRS, which many seniors have made. <br><br>

                    KHRS started as a working group of arrhythmia under the Korean Society of Cardiology in 1997 and became the Korean Heart Rhythm Society in January 2017. As of 2023, the number of members of KHRS is approaching 1,750. <br><br>

                    The 14th KHRS scientific session in 2022 was attended by 1,182 participants and held a total of 91 sessions. It has developed into a large-scale international academic conference with 145 domestic and 83 overseas speakers. <br><br>

                    Executive members and I will make the following efforts to further develop the capabilities of the rapidly growing society.
