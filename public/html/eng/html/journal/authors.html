                            <li>All manuscripts must comply with the research and publication ethics guidelines recommended by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) for the Conduct, Reporting, Editing and Publication of Scholarly Work in Medical Journals (<a href="http://www.icmje.org/icmje-recommendations.pdf" target="_blank" class="link">http://www.icmje.org/icmje-recommendations.pdf</a>).</li>
                            <li>In all manuscripts, authors should refer to the principles embodied in the Declaration of Helsinki (<a href="http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/b3/index.html" target="_blank" class="link">http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/b3/index.html</a>) for all investigations involving human materials and be reviewed by Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC).</li>
                            <li>Animal experiments also should be reviewed by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) for the care and use of animals. Also studies with pathogens requiring a high degree of biosafety should pass a review by the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC).</li>
                            <li>If necessary, the editorial board may request copies of informed consents from human subjects in clinical studies or IRB approval documents.</li>
                            <li>'Author' is defined as person who contributed substantial intellectual contributions to the manuscript. The substantial intellectual contribution is defined as 1) to participate in the conception and design, acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data; 2) drafting the article or revising it for intellectual content; 3) final approval to be published; and 4) agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved. All authors should meet all four criteria. The corresponding author is defined as an author who meets the four criteria and also should be available throughout the full processes and after publication. When submitting a manuscript authored by a group, the corresponding author should clearly indicate the preferred citation and identify all individual authors as well as the group name.</li>
                            <li>A conflict of interest may exist when an author (or the author's institution or employer) has financial or personal relationships or affiliations that could influence (or bias) the author's decisions, work, or manuscript. The corresponding author of an article can be asked to inform the Editor of the authors' potential conflicts of interest which could possibly influence their interpretation of data and all authors should clearly disclose their potential conflicts of interest before submitting the article. In particular, all sources of funding for a study should be stated explicitly. All authors must write and submit the form for disclosure of potential conflicts of interest.

All sources of funding should be declared in a section titled "Acknowledgment" at the end of the text.</li>

Secondary publication for various other reasons, in the different journal, another language, especially in other countries, is justifiable and can be beneficial provided that the following conditions are met. In such instances, the author has to receive approval from the editor-in-chief of both journals. The paper for secondary publication is intended for a different group of readers; an abbreviated version could be sufficient. The secondary version faithfully reflects the data and interpretations of the primary version. The footnote on the title page of the secondary version informs readers, peers, and documenting agencies that the paper has been published in whole or in part and states the primary reference.</li>
